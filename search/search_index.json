If you  found these  results useful, please cite our zenodo repository:  10.5281/zenodo.10728422.</p> <p>Although it has been shown multiple times that correcting defocus gradients is very  important for subtomogram averaging in tilt-series data, the effects on particle  localization have not been clearly illustrated (to my knowledge). The software Warp  introduced a detailed correction of defocus gradients during template matching by  splitting the tomogram into many small sub-boxes where the template can be corrected  by tilt-dependent defocus offsets  that adhere to the sample geometry. For an untilted image these  offsets are a function of the z-coordinate in the tomogram, while for tilted image the  defocus gradient is a function of both the x- and z-coordinate in the tomogram  (assuming the  tilt-axis is aligned with the y-axis). The defocus gradient are therefore expected  to be the strongest for the images collected a high sample tilts. Considering that the  resolution in tomograms is generally not considered to be high due to alignment errors  and that the high tilt angles usually have an additional drop-off in resolution due to  beam damage, I wondered how much effect defocus gradient correction actually has  on the template matching scores. To test this in this benchmark, I here try to measure  the defocus  handedness of a tomogram.</p>"},{"location":"benchmarks/defocus_handedness/#approach","title":"Approach","text":"Initial view of the data: annotations (turqoise sphere) made by  pytom-match-pick on tomogram 27 of EMPIAR-10985. <p>To properly measure the defocus handedness, I selected a dataset of isolated  ribosomes in thin ice collected at a pixel size of 1.07 \u00c5  (EMPIAR-10985; see figure above). Isolated macromolecules provide the highest  resolution (contrary to in situ data). I used an approach, similar  to Warp,  that calculates the defocus offsets in each subvolume of a tomogram. To measure the  effects of correcting for defocus gradients, I  ran template matching assuming both a default and inverted defocus handedness of the  tilt-series. This inverted handedness comes down to  inverting the tilt angles during  calculation of the defocus offsets. Either one of these two handedness' should be  correct and hopefully influence the results sufficiently to see a difference. </p> <p>The defocus offsets are calculated as</p> <pre><code>z_offset = z_coordinate * cos(tilt_angle) + x_coordinate * sin(tilt_angle) \n</code></pre> <p>where <code>z_coordinate</code> and <code>x_coordinate</code> are the center of the subvolume relative to  the center of the tomogram. A similar calculation could be applied for calculating  the defocus offsets of a subtomogram centered on a particle in the dataset. The  <code>z_offset</code> is then scaled to the correct units (\u03bcm).  </p> <p>I do not apply phase flipping to the tilt series prior (or during) reconstruction,  instead I modulate the template with oscillating CTF's that should match the CTF's  of each tilt image.</p> <p>The resolution of sampling defocus offsets is in this dataset primarily defined by the  number of subvolumes along the x-axis of the tomogram. As the ice layer is very thin, there will not be much variation along the z-axis. Therefore, I chose here to sample  3 subvolumes along the x-axis. More subvolumes should improve the model of the  defocus gradient, however, I assumed that this would be sufficient to measure a  difference  between regular and inverted defocus handedness. </p>"},{"location":"benchmarks/defocus_handedness/#results","title":"Results","text":"<p>To assess the effects of the defocus handedness on the template matching scores, I  analyzed the results as a function of the x-coordinate (see figure below).

Around the center  of the tomogram (x=0) the scattered points seems to overlap, which should be the  case as the central subvolume does not have defocus offsets. Only on the left and  right side of the plot, there appears a tiny increase in LCC<sub>max</sub> scores  for the inverted defocus handedness. To better assess the effect, I fitted a quadratic  function to both sets of  LCC<sub>max</sub> scores as a function of the x-coordinate (right side of figure).  This visualization makes it more easily discernible that there is an increase in  LCC<sub>max</sub> values on both the left and right side for the inverted defocus  handedness.

The diameter of a ribosome is roughly 300 \u00c5, which means we need at least (300 \u00c5 / 13.79 \u00c5 =) 22 pixels to cover the ribosome. With some overhang we extend it to 24 pixels diameter, and therefore set the mask radius (<code>--radius</code>) to 12 pixels.

Even though each tilt-series will have  different defocus values, we only specify an approximate value here as this is usually  sufficient for ribosomes. The amplitude contrast, spherical abberation, and voltage  are necessary parameters to model the CTF. The <code>--tomogram-ctf-model phase-flip</code>  option takes the <code>absolute()</code> of the CTF before applying it. This is because the  tomograms have been CTF-corrected which is done through phase-flipping.</p> <p>Then, we specify a low-pass filter of 40 \u00c5 which can be used to avoid bias. However,  it also influences the angular sampling. This sampling is calculated from the Crowther  criterion using a diameter \\(d\\) of 300 \u00c5 and a \\(r_{max}\\) of 1/(40 \u00c5) (due to the  low-pass filter), which results in a roughly 7\u00b0 increment. </p> <p>Finally, the program was started on the system GPU with index 0.

Although unlikely to happen during the tutorial, in later usage of the software your GPUs might run out of memory. This is especially likely for 4x or lower binned tomograms. If this happens, you can use the <code>--split</code> option to tile the tomogram into multiple sections. You need to specify the number of splits along each dimension, for example <code>--split 2 1 1</code> will split into 2 sections along the x-axis, <code>--split 2 2 1</code> will split once in x and once in y, resulting in 4 subvolumes!</p> <p>To visualize the results it can be very informative to open the tomogram and score map side-by-side in Napari.
