This page describes the general usage of the software.

## Overview

Features in a tomogram that resemble a structural 'template' can be localized in an automated fashion using 'template matching'. In this approach a 3D template is correlated with a given tomogram. In this procedure the different possible rotations and translations are sampled exhaustively using the algorithm described in [FÃ¶rster et al. (2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879(10)83011-3).

## Requirements

For usage you need at least a set of reconstructed tomograms in the MRC format and a template structure in the MRC format. Tomograms in IMOD format (.rec) are also okay but need to be renamed (or softlinked!) to have the correct extension (.mrc). Tomograms are ideally binned 6x or 8x to prevent excessive runtimes. The template can be an EM reconstruction (from the EMDB) or a PDB that was coverted to a density (for example via Chimera molmap).

## Template matching workflow

Using template matching in this software consists of the following steps:

1. Creating a template and mask
2. Matching the template in a tomogram
3. Extracting particles
4. Merging annotations for export to other software


## 1. Creating a template and mask

**Important**:
- The template and mask need to have the same box size.
- The template needs to have the same contrast as the tomogram (e.g. the particles 
  are black in both the tomogram and template). Contrast can be adjusted with the 
  `--invert` option.

### pytom_create_template.py

Using an EM map as a reference structure generally leads to the best results. Alternatively a structure from the PDB can be converted in Chimera(X) using the molmap command to create an MRC file that models the electrostatic potential.

```python exec="on" result="ansi" 
import argparse
code = ("""
---8<--- "entry_points.py:create_template_usage"
""")
cleaned_lines = [line.lstrip() for line in code.splitlines()
    if not any(keyword in line for keyword in ('action=', 'default=', 'type='))
]
cleaned_code = '\n'.join(cleaned_lines)
exec(cleaned_code)
print(parser.format_help())
```

### pytom_create_mask.py

The mask around the template can be quite tight to remove as much noise as possible around the particles of interest. We recommend around 10%-20% overhang relative to the particle radius. You can also generate an ellipsoidal mask for particles that do not approximate well as a sphere. Though you will probably need to reorient this mask in chimera and resample to the grid of the template. Optionally you could also create a structured mask around the template in external software (via thresholding and dilation for example). Take into account that non-spherical masks roughly double the template matching computation time.

```python exec="on" result="ansi"
import argparse
code = ("""
---8<--- "entry_points.py:create_mask_usage"
""")
cleaned_lines = [line.lstrip() for line in code.splitlines()
    if not any(keyword in line for keyword in ('action=', 'default=', 'type='))
]
cleaned_code = '\n'.join(cleaned_lines)
exec(cleaned_code)
print(parser.format_help())
```

## 2. Matching the template in a tomogram

### pytom_match_template.py

This script requires at least a tomogram, a template, a mask, the min and max tilt angles (for missing wedge constraint), an angular search, and a GPU index to run. The search can be limited along any dimension with the `--search-x`, `--search-y`, and `--search-z` parameters; for example to skip some empty regions in the z-dimension where the ice layer is not yet present, or to remove some reconstruction artifact region along the x-dimension. With the `--volume-split` option, a tomogram can be split into chunks to allow them to fit in GPU memory (useful for large tomograms). Providing multiple GPU's will allow the program to split the angular search (or the subvolume search) over multiple cards to speed up the algorithm. 

The software automatically calculates the angular search based on the available 
resolution and provided particle diameter. The required search is found from the 
Crowther criterion $\Delta \alpha = \frac{180}{\pi r_{max} d}$. For the maximal 
resolution the voxel size is used, unless a low-pass filter is specified as this 
limits the available maximal resolution. You can exploit this to reduce the angular 
search! For non-spherical particles we suggest choosing the particle diameter as the 
longest axis of the macromolecule. 

In case the template matching is run with a non-spherical mask, it is essential to set the `--non-spherical-mask` flag. It requires a slight modification of the calculation that will roughly double the computation time, so only use non-spherical masks if absolutely necessary.

#### Optimizing results: per tilt weighting with CTFs and dose accumulation

Optimal results are obtained by also incorporating information for the 3D CTF. You 
can pass the following files (and parameters):
- Tilt angles: a `.rawtlt` or `.tlt` file to the `--tilt-angles` parameter with all the 
  tilt 
  angles used to reconstruct the tomogram. You should then also set the 
  `--per-tilt-weighting` flag.
- CTF data: a `.defocus` file from IMOD or `.txt` file to `--defocus-file`. The `.txt` file 
  should specify the defocus of each tilt in **$\micro m$**. You can also give a 
  single defocus value (in $\micro m$). The CTF will also require input for 
  `--voltage`, `--amplitude-contrast`, and `--spherical-abberation`.
- Dose weighting: a `.txt` file to `--dose-accumulation` with the accumulated dose per 
  tilt (assuming the same ordering as `.tlt`). Each line contains a single float 
  specifying the accumulated dose in **e-/A2**. Dose weighting only works in 
  combination with `--per-tilt-weighting`.

_(As a side note, you can also only enable `--per-tilt-weighting` **without** dose accumulation and CTFs, or **with either** dose accumulation or CTFs.)_

When enabling the CTF model here (with the defocus file), it is important that the template is not multiplied with a CTF before passing it to this script. The template only needs to be scaled to the correct pixel size and the contrast should be adjusted to match the contrast in the tomograms.

Secondly, if the tomogram was CTF corrected, for example by using IMODs 
strip-based CTF correction or NovaCTF. Its important to add the parameter 
`--tomogram-ctf-model phase-flip` which modifies the template CTF to match the 
tomograms CTF correction.

#### Background corrections

The software contains two background correction methods that might improve results: 
`--spectral-whitening` or `--random-phase-correction` (from STOPGAP). In our 
experience the random phase correction is most reliable, while spectral whitening 
never seemed to clearly improve results.

import argparse
code = ("""

cleaned_lines = [line.lstrip() for line in code.splitlines()

]
cleaned_code = '\n'.join(cleaned_lines)
exec(cleaned_code)
print(parser.format_help())
```
